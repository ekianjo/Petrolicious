#title page with logo or simply text of petrolicious with cool font
#use pygame or mplayer to play music in menu

#use ytdl for downloading videos - display download status or bar
#use mplayer for video playback - once video downloaded. 
#detects the best video format/size for the system - for pandora it would be 480 webm. for desktop probably Full HD
#sync with online server for pictures - and videos list. 
#transition effects between scenes (fade in fade out, with slight movement).

#confirm performance of pygame libraries for this. Should be good enough, but need to check.
